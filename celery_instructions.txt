STEP 1
start basic django project
(env) pip install celery 

#install rabbitmq-server
sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server

#enable server
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server

STEP 2 (each time we have to do)
#start rabbitmq-server on a terminal window
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server

#get status of running rabbitmq-server
systemctl status rabbitmq-server 

#to stop rabbitmq-server (try at the end) 
sudo rabbitmqctl stop


#Open another terminal with pyhton environment and the test_celery folder is the project folder where settings.py file exists
celery -A test_celery worker -l info






#to test celery shared tasks (but it doesn't contain right right now os ignore the following code)
python manage.py shell

from base.tasks import add
add.delay(4,3)
<AsyncResult: 0982345y2io3uy5u4jk234h5>

#to delay the process of being executed after countdown
add.apply_async((4,3), countdown=5)


previous tasks are being runing in background even after i restarted.

I think it will create the 100 users first and then 50 more.
